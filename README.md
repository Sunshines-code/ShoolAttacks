# ShoolAttacks
Small ETLD project showing the rates of school attacks by country and by year from 2013-2017


I like digging through free data sources on occasion and wanted to see which countries came out the worst based on the school atttack data from 2013-2017.
The process is simple as it only involves csv files, poandas and plotly.
